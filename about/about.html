            <div class="subsection">
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Origin Story</h3>
                <p>Rimuru Tempest was originally a human named Satoru Mikami, a 37-year-old corporate worker in Tokyo who lived an ordinary life. His life took a dramatic turn when he was stabbed while trying to protect his colleague from an attacker. As he lay dying, he heard a mysterious voice that led to his reincarnation in a fantasy world as a slime.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p>Upon awakening in this new world, Rimuru discovered unique abilities including "Predator" which allows absorption of creatures and objects, and "Great Sage" (later evolving into "Raphael"), an advanced analytical skill that provides guidance and problem-solving capabilities.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>His first encounter in this new world was with Veldora Tempest, the "Storm Dragon," who became his first true friend. Rimuru named Veldora after the dragon named him "Rimuru Tempest," marking the beginning of their deep bond.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="subsection">
                <h3 class="subsection-title">Transformation and Growth</h3>
                <p>After absorbing Veldora (to free him from imprisonment while maintaining their connection), Rimuru gained tremendous power and set out to explore the world. His journey led him to the Jura Forest where he encountered goblins being attacked by direwolves. This encounter marked the beginning of his role as a leader and protector.</p>

Through his leadership and the alliances he formed with various monster races (ogres, direwolves, lizardmen, and others), it grew into a prosperous nation recognized by human kingdoms and other world powers.</p>
